###############
This program implements a scapegoat tree as described in the following paper:
http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~morin/teaching/5408/refs/gr93.pdf

Input to the program is a file called tree.txt. You can also specify a different
file on the command line. The first line of the file must be:
    BuildTree alpha key
where .5 <= alpha < 1, and key is an integer. Each line of the rest of the file
must contain one of the following commands:
    Insert key - inserts the integer key into the tree
    Search key - finds the specified key in the tree if it exists or gives an
                 error message 
    Delete key - delete the specified key from the tree
    Print - prints the tree structure in *pre-order* (i.e. the root is the first
            node displayed)
    Done - exits the program
key must be a unique integer.

# How to Build #

No installation is required. The program runs through the python interrepter.

# How to Use #
##############
Without arguments, the program assumes there is a file called tree.txt in the
current working directory, and uses that for input:
python scapegoat.py

With an argument, the program uses it as the input file;
python scapegoat.py input_file.txt
